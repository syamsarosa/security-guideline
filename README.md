Security is one of the main concern when we create an app. Having customer calls saying that their app is hacked is a ticket to nightmare hours, days even weeks.

When we talk about security, the ranges itself is quite huge. Simply because there are a lot of things that can be exploited starting from the front end to the server itself.

In this guide, I decide to put up some of the list I found on my software development journey. This list is not complete, and most likely never will.
